## About the Game

**Fiasco Circus** is a dark and whimsical game developed during the **Global Game Jam 2025** held at İzmir Ekonomi Üniversitesi.

The user was responsible for the majority of the character designs and animations, all of which were created using **Aseprite**, with the exception of the opening screen and in-game backgrounds. The project showcases creative character art, smooth animations, and an engaging experience.
